Info: At least one many-to-many mesh interface is found in the case file. Such mesh interfaces will not be available in a future release of Fluent. It is recommended to convert to the current default one-to-one mesh interfaces with the following text command:
/define/mesh-interfaces/one-to-one-pairing? yes

The automatic selection for flux type has changed to Rhie-Chow: momentum based.

Done.
