   abstract = {The use of CubeSat-like small satellites is growing exponentially nowadays, pushing towards missions of increased complexity, including Earth imaging, commercial communications and astronomical observations. As such, they might require components that may survive the re-entry conditions and reach the ground, posing risks for population and properties, or that are intended to be retrieved. The possibility of demise and ground impact poses many challenges from the modeling standpoint because of the uncertainties associated with both the aero- and the aerothermo-dynamic models of the spacecraft. Several formulations and correlations can be found in the literature. Most of them are derived in dated and difficult-to-access papers and technical reports. This paper collects all the necessary and sufficient models, laws and data to describe in a comprehensive way the re-entry of small satellites. They are presented in an organized fashion, with uniform nomenclature and consistent assumptions in order to provide the smallsats scientific community with a smallsats specific, easy-to-understand and rapid-to-implement tool. Furthermore, the paper originally presents an approximated aero- and aerothermo-dynamic model of the Drag De-Orbit Device, a recently developed drag modulation device for drag-based controlled re-entry of large CubeSats.},

   abstract = {In this paper, an explicit model predictive controller for the attitude of a satellite is designed. Explicit solutions to constrained linear MPC problems can be computed by solving multi-parametric quadratic programs (mpQP), where the parameters are the components of the state vector. The solution to the mpQP is a piecewise affine (PWA) function, which can be evaluated at each sample to obtain the optimal control law. The on-line computation effort is restricted to a table-lookup, and the controller can be implemented on inexpensive hardware as fixed-point arithmetics can be used. This is useful for systems with limited power and CPU resources. An example of such systems is micro-satellites, which is the focus of this paper. In particular, the explicit MPC (eMPC) approach is applied to the SSETI/ESEO micro-satellite, initiated by the European Space Agency (esa).

   abstract = {Electron beam stabilization in a synchrotron is a large-scale disturbance rejection problem, with hundreds of inputs and outputs, that is sampled at frequencies higher than 10kHz. In this feasibility study, we focus on the practical issues of implementing model predictive control (MPC) for the heavily ill-conditioned plant of the electron beam stabilization problem at Diamond Light Source. If the terminal cost matrix of the MPC problem is obtained from the discrete-time algebraic Riccati equation (DARE), the ill-conditioned plant results in an ill-conditioned Hessian. Here, we propose obtaining a stabilizing terminal cost matrix from a modified version of the DARE that includes a constraint on the condition number of the Hessian. We implement our control algorithm on the hardware designated for the imminent Diamond Light Source upgrade, and show that the modified terminal cost matrix allows MPC to be executed at the rate required for synchrotron control. MPC overcomes various problems of standard electron beam stabilization techniques, and we show that the successful implementation can increase the stability of photon beams in synchrotron light sources.},
